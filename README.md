# AI in Managing Stock Processes – Business Process Management Project

A practical academic project developed in the **Business Process Management** module  
- FHNW – BSc Business Information Technology  
- Group Work | Fall Semester 2023  

---

## Project Summary

This project focuses on enhancing logistics processes at **Three**, a multinational telecom company, through Business Process Management and **AI integration**. The initiative builds upon the foundational case by Karle & Teichenthaler (2018), analyzing three critical logistics processes and proposing improvements to boost performance and efficiency:

- **Manage Stock**
- **Receive Orders**
- **Return Processing**

By leveraging AI, the project introduces automation in forecasting and supplier evaluation and delivers a **Python prototype** that simulates demand prediction using regression modeling.

|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Process Optimization         | Streamline logistics processes using BPM and automation      |
| Leverage AI                  | Apply AI to demand forecasting and supplier performance       |
| Improve Inventory Accuracy   | Minimize errors through system enhancement                   |
| Reduce Operational Cost      | Automate repetitive tasks and optimize workflows             |
| Simulation via Prototyping   | Build a Python prototype to demonstrate predictive analytics |

## Core Processes Analyzed

- **Manage Stock**  
  Analyzed using “Why-Why” diagrams and process evaluation metrics to identify pain points and improvement opportunities.
  
- **Receive Orders**  
  Manual inefficiencies (data entry, supplier communication) were evaluated for automation potential.

- **Return Processing**  
  Explored to address issues related to customer returns and internal process fragmentation.

|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Stock Replenishment  | Predict demand and replenish automatically | Regression model for forecast accuracy |
| Demand Forecasting   | Analyze patterns and segment demand        | AI-assisted time series segmentation   |
| Supplier Management  | Monitor performance using KPIs            | AI for analytics and alerts            |

## Intelligent Process Automation

AI was integrated into the following areas:
- **Forecasting**: Automated demand predictions using regression models
- **Supplier Evaluation**: Performance-based analytics and predictive alerts
- **Process Decision Support**: Reduce errors, enhance responsiveness

---

## Python Prototype

A working **JupyterLite notebook** was created to simulate:
- Demand data generation for mobile devices and SIM cards
- Linear regression using `scikit-learn`
- Visualization of predictions using `matplotlib`

**Key Features:**
- Generates synthetic demand data
- Builds and trains regression models
- Visualizes trendlines to support demand planning
